# ToDoList
A list of tasks written in C++. Console input and output, data is stored in a .txt file. Each task has a name, description, deadline by date, deadline by time, and completion status. When working, it is possible to add a new task, change an old one, mark the task completed or unfulfilled, delete the task and sort the task list. There are three types of sorting: alphabetically, by the status of completion and by the approach of the deadline. Reverse sorting is also possible. Beautiful list output to the console with alignment of all columns and text color change. When the deadline is overdue, it turns red, yellow if the deadline is today, but not yet overdue, and green if the deadline has passed, but the task is marked completed. In the file test.txt there is a pre-generated list of tasks for testing, if necessary.
